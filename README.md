# face-tracking-rs

Aims to implement face tracking system by [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle) in Rust.

## Features

- BlaceFace
    - A lightweight face detection model.
    - [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.05047)

- 4faces.png: from Andrew Ngâ€™s Facebook page / [KDnuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/03/talking-machine-deep-learning-gurus-p1.html)

These images were scaled down to 128x128 pixels as that is the expected input size of the model.
